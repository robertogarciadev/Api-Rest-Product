# API REST

Rest API for managing products, manufacturers, distributors and categories. To create this APP I have used Spring Boot, WEB, JPA and other types of Sping libraries. The database used was MySQL. I have also used the Postman tool to generate Http requests. This exercise has helped me practice the types of relationships with Spring Boot annotations.
